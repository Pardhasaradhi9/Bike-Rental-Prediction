Introduction:
Using R programming and machine learning approaches, we record in this paper the completion of several data science projects linked to bike rental prediction. The goals included creating a model using the random forest algorithm, evaluating the effectiveness of the model, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Methodology:
Loaded the dataset using R programming and relevant libraries.
Conducted data type conversion of attributes to ensure consistency and accuracy in analysis.
Performed missing value analysis to identify and handle any missing values in the dataset.
Insights:
Distribution of Temperature: The histogram displayed a somewhat uniform distribution with multiple peaks, indicating common temperatures around 0.5.
Distribution of Feeling Temperature: The histogram exhibited multiple peaks, skewed to the right, suggesting higher feeling temperatures are more common.
Distribution of Humidity: The histogram was left-skewed, indicating lower humidity levels were less frequent, with a significant peak observed around 0.75-0.85.
Distribution of Windspeed: The windspeed distribution was right-skewed, with lower windspeeds being more frequent, suggesting calm weather conditions dominate.
Logic:
EDA is essential for understanding the dataset's structure, identifying patterns, and preparing data for further analysis.
Data type conversion ensures proper data representation and compatibility for analysis.
Missing value analysis helps identify any data gaps and informs decision-making regarding missing data handling strategies.
Task 2: Attributes Distribution and Trends

Methodology:
Plotted monthly and yearly distributions of total bikes rented to visualize seasonal and annual trends.
Created boxplot for outliers' analysis to detect any anomalous data points.
Insights:
Seasonal Trends: Bike rentals follow a clear seasonal pattern, with lowest rentals during winter months and peak rentals during warmer months.
Monthly and Yearly Distributions: Monthly and yearly distributions revealed seasonal and annual variations in rental patterns, indicating peaks and troughs based on weather and seasonality.
Outliers' Analysis: No outliers were found, indicating a consistent dataset without significant anomalies.
Logic:
Analyzing attributes' distribution helps identify patterns and trends in bike rental data.
Monthly and yearly distributions reveal seasonal and annual variations in rental patterns, which are crucial for understanding bike usage trends.
Outliers' analysis helps identify any unusual data points that may require further investigation or data preprocessing.
Task 3: Dataset Splitting and Model Creation

Methodology:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test datasets using an 80:10:10 ratio.
Created a random forest model using the training dataset.
Logic:
Dataset splitting into training, validation, and test sets ensures robust model evaluation and prevents overfitting.
Random forest algorithm was chosen for its ability to handle complex datasets and provide accurate predictions in regression tasks like bike rental prediction.
Using an 80:10:10 split ratio allows sufficient data for training, validation, and testing while maintaining a balance between model performance and data utilization.
Model Evaluation:

Validation Data MAE: 471.37
Test Data MAE: 697.70
Insights:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on validation and test data provides insights into the model's accuracy in predicting bike rental counts.
Lower MAE values indicate better model performance, with the validation data showing relatively lower error compared to the test data.
Conclusion:
The completion of these tasks involved a systematic approach to data analysis, preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation. Through exploratory data analysis, we gained insights into the dataset's structure and identified key attributes for modeling. By creating a random forest model and evaluating its performance, we demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings.

Recommendations:

Further optimization of the model may be explored to improve prediction accuracy.
Continuous monitoring of model performance and refinement of data preprocessing techniques can enhance model robustness.
